# Proptest Regressions
This directory contains seeds for test failure cases previously generated by [proptest](https://crates.io/crates/proptest).
It's recommended to check any files generated here and their changes into source control so that future test runs may benefit from additional regression testing.

Choosing to do so is ultimately at the discretion of the developer â€” some test failures could be considered trivial and temporary, but there should be no harm in committing the seeds of any failure that arises during development.
